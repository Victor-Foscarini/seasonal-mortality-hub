# Seasonal Mortality Hub

This is the repository of the most critical code of the seasonal mortality project that was part of  [InterSCity](https://interscity.org/) and [IME-USP's Systems group](https://www.ime.usp.br/en/computer-science-department/research/). The project's primary goal was to analyze the seasonal variation in mortality in Brazil, and the main result of that was the development of new methods to measure seasonality that we applied to the country. The main part of the project is on the notebook [seasonal_variation_in_mortality_in_brazil.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/seasonal_variation_in_mortality_in_brazil.ipynb), where we compare seasonality across Brazilian states using different measures of seasonality: the Excess Winter Death index (EWDi), the Peak Season Excess Death index (PSEDi, which we also call just EDi on the code), the Excess Death with Variable Length index (EDVLi), and the Peak-to-Trough Ratio (PTR). The EWDi and the PSEDi are simple and we only rely on the counts of mortality, while for the EDVLi we rely on [Dynp’s algorithm](https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/code-reference/detection/dynp-reference/#ruptures.detection.dynp.Dynp) to detect the change points using dynamic programming before finding the period with more seasonality, and for the PTR we rely on [statmodel’s cyclic cubic spline algorithm](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.gam.smooth_basis.CyclicCubicSplines.html) to model the time series before obtaining the peaks and throughs.

We used healthcare data from [SIM-DATASUS](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/pesquisa/censo-demografico/demografico-2022/universo-alfabetizacao), IBGE demographic data from [population estimation](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/9103-estimativas-de-populacao) and [census](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/pesquisa/censo-demografico/demografico-2022/universo-alfabetizacao), and historical climate data from [INMET's automatic stations](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/dadoshistoricos). Additionally, we extracted the ICD-10 codes from the [WHO website](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en). The data processing code is divided into jupyter notebooks containing different research steps. We start with [extracting_datasus_data.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/extracting_datasus_data.ipynb), using an R API to get the mortality data for our study. Then, in [preprocessing_datasus_data.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/preprocessing_datasus_data.ipynb), we perform the necessary aggregations and transformations on the mortality data needed for the analysis, enriching it with demographic data. In [preprocessing_inmet_data.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/preprocessing_inmet_data.ipynb), we do similar preprocessing for climate data, aggregating it, and dealing with missing data. After that, the notebooks [seasonal_variation_in_mortality_in_brazil.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/seasonal_variation_in_mortality_in_brazil.ipynb) and [climate_and_mortality_data_in_brazil.ipynb](https://github.com/Victor-Foscarini/seasonal-mortality-hub/blob/main/climate_and_mortality_in_brazil.ipynb) contains the analyses themselves, respectively, of the various metrics used and their values across the country and the study of the climate factors influencing mortality in three strategic cities chosen from the results of the seasonality analysis.

The procedures of the data processing for the research are also available on my medium:

# How to run

The code was developed on Google Colab, making it the optimal platform for execution. However, it can also be run on a local machine using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, or even on another cloud service. To do so, ensure you install the required libraries with the versions specified in the first code block of each notebook and update the path variables to suitable local paths.

# Contribution

I, Victor Foscarini Almeida, wrote most of the code during my master's degree, supervised by Fabio Kon and co-supervised by Raphael Carmago.
